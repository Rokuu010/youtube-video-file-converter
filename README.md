# My Video Converter Web App

A personal project I built to create a simple, clean tool for converting video and audio files, made mainly with Java and Spring Boot.

## üìñ About The Project

I wanted to create a project for my **portfolio** that would showcase my **Java skills** and demonstrate my ability to build a small full-stack web application. The idea for a media file converter was perfect, as it requires handling file uploads, managing backend processing logic, and integrating third-party tools.

This project started out as a simple command-line tool but I decided to challenge myself and evolve it into a **full-fledged web application**. This journey taught me a lot about building a backend with **Spring Boot**, handling web requests and **file uploads**, and integrating powerful **third-party tools** like FFmpeg via a Java wrapper.

The end result is a clean, simple, single-page web app that focuses on performing core conversions efficiently.

## üöÄ Getting Started

If you want to get a copy of this running on your own machine, here‚Äôs how.

### Prerequisites

You'll need a few things installed on your system first:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later.**
* **Apache Maven.**
* **FFmpeg:** This is the core engine that does all the converting. It needs to be installed and available on your system's PATH.
    * *macOS (Homebrew):* `brew install ffmpeg`
    * *Windows (Scoop/Chocolatey):* `scoop install ffmpeg` or `choco install ffmpeg`
    * *Linux (apt):* `sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg`

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/video-converter.git](https://github.com/your-username/video-converter.git)
    ```
2.  **Jump into the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd video-converter
    ```
3.  **Run the app with Maven:**
    * On macOS/Linux:
        ```sh
        ./mvnw spring-boot:run
        ```
    * On Windows:
        ```sh
        mvnw spring-boot:run
        ```
The app will start up, and you'll see a message in the console like `Tomcat started on port(s): 8080`.
